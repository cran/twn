Description: The TWN-list (Taxa Waterbeheer Nederland) is the Dutch standard for naming 
    taxons in Dutch Watermanagement. This package makes it easier to use the 
    TWN-list for ecological analyses. It  consists of two parts. First it makes the 
    TWN-list itself available in R. Second, it has a few functions that make it 
    easy to perform some basic and often recurring tasks for checking and consulting
    taxonomic data from the TWN-list.
